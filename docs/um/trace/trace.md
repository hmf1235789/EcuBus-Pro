## Column Information

The Trace window typically includes the following columns:

- **Timestamp**: Displays the precise time when the event occurred
- **Name**: Represents the frame signal name that triggered the event
- **Signal Value**: Shows the current value of the signal
- **DIR (Direction)**: Indicates the signal direction (Tx for transmit, Rx for receive)
- **ID**: Represents the signal identifier
- **DLC (Data Length Code)**: Shows the data length code
- **LEN (Length)**: Displays the actual data length
- **Type**: Indicates the signal type (e.g., boolean, integer, float)
- **Channel**: Shows the communication channel number
- **Device**: Displays the device name

When the corresponding hardware channel is bound to a [database](../database.md), these column information helps users quickly understand and analyze the system's operating state.

> Signal values within frames can only be viewed when the Trace window is paused
